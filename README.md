# Code Projects

 Here you will find a number of simple pieces of code within the learning directory that i created to get back in programming after a awhile not having the availiable time to keep in practice as well as some that were me trying out different ways to do something or the basis of larger idea.

Here you will also find some larger projects that i have worked on which were more me trying to see if i could take a simple idea and get all the way from the initial idea to a working finished product.
